I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple Redis front client I made for testing. The main use of this program is data entry with Redis as the database.

UI created in Qt Designer

Click on run.bat to run the program, the bat file will install pyside6, qdarkstyle and redis if they are not already installed on your system and start the application.

Tested with [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/)
